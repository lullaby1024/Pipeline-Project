# Recipecialist

This application is the project of _COMS4995 sec.009 **Data-Analytics Pipeline**_.

This product targets users who love foods and like to cook by themselves. Users can use their phone to take pictures of ingredients available at hand, and our application would recognize those ingredients. Based on the ingredients, the application would recommend corresponding recipes with such ingredients to users.

Below is the **minimum viable product** diagram of this application.

We use two services in this MVP: **image recognition service** and **recommender service**.

After a photo is uploaded to the app,  the **image recognition service** will recognize the ingredient through a model trained using image database. Then, the ingredient is passed to the **recommender service** , which will use recipe database to recommend recipes based on the ingredient recognized. 

## Get Start (Demo Implementation)

1. run

   ```python
   python app.py
   ```

2. open a browser and nevigate to `0.0.0.0:7777`. An index page with instructions to upload the ingredient photo will show. Upload a photo by clicking on the button.

   Here we tested a simple photo of tomatoes.

   The uploading service is handled by `UploadHandler()`. If the file is successfuly uploaded, a message will be sent.

3. Enter `0.0.0.0:7777/recommend` in the address bar. This will trigger the `MainHandler()` to call the model with the given image and return recommended recipes.
